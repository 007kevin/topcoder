PROBLEM STATEMENT
There are N people.
Each of them was given the same survey that consisted of M questions.
The people were numbered 0 through N-1, and the questions were numbered 0 
through M-1.
Each person answered each question by choosing one of the provided options.
For each question, the options were labeled using distinct uppercase letters 
('A'-'Z').

You are given the responses to the survey: a vector <string> answer with N 
elements, each consisting of M characters.
For each i and j, answer[i][j] is the answer person i chose for question j.

A set of questions is called a distinguishable set if we can use it to 
distinguish between any two of our N people.
Formally, a distinguishable set of questions has the property that no two 
people have the same sequence of responses to those questions.

The set of questions used in the survey has exactly 2^M subsets.
Count how many of those subsets are distinguishable sets, and return that count.

DEFINITION
Class:DistinguishableSetDiv2
Method:count
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:int
Method signature:int count(vector <string> answer)


CONSTRAINTS
-N will be between 2 and 50, inclusive.
-M will be between 1 and 10, inclusive.
-answer will contain exactly N elements, inclusive.
-Each element in answer will contain exactly M characters, inclusive.
-Each character in answer will be a uppercase letter ('A'-'Z').


EXAMPLES

0)
{"AA","AB","CC"}

Returns: 2

There are 4 subsets of questions: {}, {0}, {1}, and {0,1}.
Let's look at each of them separately.

For the empty subset {} each person gave the same sequence of answers (an 
empty sequence).
For the subset {0} the answers given by the three people were "A", "A", and 
"C". Note that two of the people gave the same response.
For the subset {1} the answers given by the three people were "A", "B", and 
"C". Note that all three responses are distinct.
For the subset {0,1} the answers given by the three people were "AA", "AB", 
and "CC". Again, note that all three responses are distinct.

Thus, there are 2 distinguishable sets: {1} and {0,1}.

1)
{"XYZ","XYZ","XYZ"}

Returns: 0

Each person gave exactly the same sequence of answers.
Thus, no subset of questions is a distinguishable set.
The correct return value in such a case is 0.

2)
{"AAAA","BACA","CDCE"}

Returns: 11

Among the 16 possible subsets of these questions there are 11 distinguishable 
sets.
The five subsets of questions that are not distinguishable sets are {}, {1}, 
{2}, {3}, and {1,3}. 

3)
{"HGHHGUHUHI","BQHJWOSZMM","NDKSKCNXND","QOEOEIWIDS","IIQIWUNNZM"}

Returns: 1017



4)
{"XYZ","XAB","YAC"}

Returns: 5
