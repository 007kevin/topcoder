PROBLEM STATEMENT
A number is preprime if it has exactly 4 positive integer divisors.  For 
example, 6 is preprime because its divisors are 1, 2, 3, and 6.  The integers 
6, 8, 10, 14 form the beginning of an infinite sequence of preprime numbers. 
Find the n-th element of this sequence, where n is a 1-based index.

DEFINITION
