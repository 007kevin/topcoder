PROBLEM STATEMENT
A palindrome is a sequence of letters that reads the same forwards and 
backwards, such as "MOM".
Given two strings, s and t, you are to find the length of the longest 
palindrome that is a contiguous substring of some interleaving of s and t.  
For example, the strings "AA" and "BB" can be interleaved in six ways:

   AABB    BBAA
   ABAB    BABA
   ABBA    BAAB
 
Of these, the top two contain palindromes of length 2 ("AA" and "BB"), the 
middle two contain palindromes of length 3 ("ABA" and "BAB"), and the bottom 
two contain palindromes of length 4 ("ABBA" and "BAAB"), so the answer would 
be 4.



DEFINITION
Class:InterleavePal
Method:longestPal
Parameters:string, string
Returns:int
Method signature:int longestPal(string s, string t)


NOTES
-To interleave two strings, you intersperse their characters.  For example, 
"ABCDE" is one way to interleave the strings "ACE" and "BD".  However, the 
characters need not strictly alternate between the two strings.  For example, 
"BACED" and "ACBDE" are also ways to interleave the strings "ACE" and "BD".  
Notice that the characters from the original strings maintain their order with 
respect to other characters from the same string (e.g., the 'B' always comes 
before the 'D' in the above examples).
-Interleaving any string with the empty string yields the original string.


CONSTRAINTS
-s will contain between 0 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-t will contain between 0 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Every character in s will be an uppercase letter ('A'-'Z').
-Every character in t will be an uppercase letter ('A'-'Z').


EXAMPLES

0)
"AA"
"BB"

Returns: 4

The example above.

1)
""
"JAVA"

Returns: 3

The longest palindrome is "AVA".

2)
""
""

Returns: 0

The empty string is a palindrome of length 0.

3)
