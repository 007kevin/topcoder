PROBLEM STATEMENT
Fans of the game X-ball frequently use the official players' stats.  These 
stats are presented as a list of players' names and the positions they can 
play.  If a player can play at several positions, he is shown in the list once 
for each position.

The fans want to get the statistics in a new format.  In the old format, each 
element of the list contained a single player and a single position played by 
that player.  In the new format, each element of the list will contain a 
single player and all the positions that the player can play.  The new list 
must contain the same number of elements as the old one, and players must 
appear in the same order as before.  Each element of the new list must contain 
the name of the player, a '-' character, and a comma-separated list of all the 
positions the player can play.  The first position must be the same position 
that was in the corresponding element of the old list, and the other positions 
must be sorted in alphabetical order.


Old format stats:  |  New format stats:
John-DH            |  John-DH,RP,SP         
Jack-SP            |  Jack-SP               
Sam-OF             |  Sam-OF                
John-SP            |  John-SP,DH,RP         
John-RP	           |  John-RP,DH,SP         


You will be given a vector <string> placeboard containing the statistics in 
the old format.  Each element will contain a player's name and an abbreviation 
of the player's position in the form "Name-Position" (quotes for clarity).  
Return the list after converting it to the new format.
